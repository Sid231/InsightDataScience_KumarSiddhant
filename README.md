Insight Data Science coding challenge

This coding challenge has been submitted by Kumar Siddhant. Email ID: ks1306@scarletmail.rutgers.edu

This application has been developed as a part of the coding challenge set by Insight Program (Insight Fellows Programs | Insight Data Engineering Fellows Program - Seattle). The code has been developed as per the instructions of the challenge and can be tested by running the run.sh script. Once you run this script, you will get the output file in the Output folder for the input file in the input folder. Make sure you dont edit the file name in the input folder.

I have added 5 test cases in the insight_testsuite/tests folder. You can run and check all of them by running the run_tests.sh script in the insight_testsuite folder. You can also add more test cases there by adding both the input and the output files in the insight_testsuite/tests/test_x folder, and can test all of them together by running the run_tests.sh script.
